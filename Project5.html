  <br>
    <br>
  Prototype 1: Cup Holder that displays knowledge of a drink inside of it as well as retrieves the temperature of the cup via a waterproof thermometer inside the holder area, which is taken as a value and mapped to the color of the LED. As a hot drink is placed into the cup holder it will trigger the flashing LED, and the thermometer will begin reading its temperature. The peraeters I used were 80 degrees to 100 degrees, but to make it realistic, I set it to a low of 32 degrees and a high of 180 degrees. The coldest and lowest extremes correlate to 100% blue. As it gets warmer blue starts to decrease as green increases until it gets to 100% green and 0% blue which is exactly halfway between the extremes. Then as it senses a higher temperature from there the green begins to decrease and the red starts to brighten fading from yellow and orange to red at the highest extreme. This was programmed using the Arduino Uno.

  <a href="project5/video4.mp4">Prototype 2: Lighthouse Tower That Responds to Pressure Sensor Visually</a>
    <br>
  <br>
  Prototype 2: Lighthouse that fades through colors of blue and blue-green. The two color channels flicker randomly and independently of each other. Then the red color channel's brightness is mapped to the sensor reading from the pressure sensor. The harder that the user presses on it, the brighter the red LED shines, creating an effect that fades between purple and pinks. This one was programmed using the Arduino ESP32 Feather
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Our Prototypes had a lot of failures with the hardware. We just couldn't get our designs to work 100% and that really put a delay on the coding aspect of it. Finding and diagnosing the reasons for our device not working was tedious and obnoxious, but we ended up getting all of our hardware to work together at the same time. We did not have a second external power supply to power the led led driver wich we also didn't have to power the Adafruit Neopixel Strip of 8 neopixels. Since we couldn't use the neopixel strip, I mapped the temperature still to the color of a single neopixel which protrudes out from the soldered board and is easily visible when the board is sitting in the side pockets of our holder. The coding part went pretty smoothly after all the hardware was set. It was so hard to tell sometimes whether or not the problems were stemming from the hardware or the software, but after we had everything under control, the coding was actually the funnest part of the project for me. 
  <br>
  <br>
  For the project I first sketched up our designs and helped decide what parts we were going to use. I also helped by soldering various connections for the ESP3s Feather for prototype 2 and also working on the Bluetooth integration for that. So since I had the computer that connected to the devices I ended up being the one to store all the various programs and Arduino IE sketches.
  <br>
  I also made the Adobe illustrator files from the PDF files that I downloaded from that dooden box cutter diagram making website. I went with Kira and Kristie to laser cut them and the plexiglass. I came up with the design for the lighthouse tower so I was pretty happy when it turned out so awesome. 
  <br>
  And I wrote the sketches for the Arduino chips after the hardware was all completed and finished.
